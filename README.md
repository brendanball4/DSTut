### Dark Souls

This is my version of Sebastian Graves Dark Souls tutorial series
for creating a Dark Souls-like game in Unity 3D. I will be
following this series whilst adding in my own / free textures
available in the Unity Asset Store. The majority of the rigging
and animations are generated from Adobe's Mixamo.
